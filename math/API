MaxSATzilla Mathematics API
---------------------------

MaxSATzilla Mathematics API entrance point is the function:
MSZDataSet *createDataSet(double**, int, int);

Where the first argument is a matrix of doubles, the second and 
third arguments are respectively the number of lines and the number 
of columns of the matrix.

From this point on double** IS OWNED BY THE MATH LIBRARY!!!
This returns MSZDataSet which should be passed to the rest of
the functions of the library. Once the process is terminated just
delete (with the delete keyword of C++) it.
