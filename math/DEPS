- Forward Selection Algorithm relies on GSL >= 1.10 (http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)
  for algorithms and data structures.
  * There's a work around on the 1.9 versus 1.10 issue.
    To compile with 1.9 use make like this:
    $ OLDGSL=1 make
    in Bash, basically you have to define OLDGSL before running make.
